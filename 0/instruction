PRE-REQUISITES:

    install docker:
        https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/centos/
    install docker-compose, for compose on CentOS 7:
        sudo curl -L "https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/1.23.2/docker-compose-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m)" -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
        sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
    If you install CentOS watch out for XFS filesystem settings: https://docs.docker.com/storage/storagedriver/overlayfs-driver/. The simplest solution is to use EXT4.

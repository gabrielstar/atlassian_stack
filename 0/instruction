PRE-REQUISITES:

    install docker:
        https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/centos/
    install docker-compose, for compose on CentOS 7:
        sudo curl -L "https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/1.23.2/docker-compose-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m)" -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
        sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
    If you install CentOS watch out for XFS filesystem settings: https://docs.docker.com/storage/storagedriver/overlayfs-driver/. The simplest solution is to use EXT4.

WE WILL SET-UP

     APACHE over HTTPS:
            -> JIRA (with https app link to Confluence)
            -> CONFLUENCE (with https app link to Jira)
            -> CROWD

     Services placement:

        VM1: JIRA
        VM2: CONFLUENCE, POSTGRESQL and PG_ADMIN
        VM3: HTTP and CROWD

PARAMS:

    JIRA IP: ${JIRA_IP}
    CONFLUENCE IP: ${CONFLUENCE_IP}
    POSTGRES IP: ${POSTGRES_IP}
    PG_ADMIN IP: ${PG_ADMIN_IP}
    CROWD IP: ${CROWD_IP}
    HTTP IP: ${HTTP_IP}
    HTTP URL: ${HTTP_URL}

    ADMIN_USER: ${ADMIN_USER}
    ADMIN_PASS: ${ADMIN_PASS}
    MEMORY: ${MEMORY} //e.g. 1024m
    PROJECT NAME: ${PROJECT_NAME}
    DIRECTORY CROWD: ${CROWD_DIR}

HOW TO USE THIS REPO ?

    Before install activities create a new branch and replace PARAMS above with real values.
    On hosts download already personalized instructions from your branch

        yum install git && git clone https://github.com/gabrielstar/atlassian_stack.git && cd atlassian_stack &&  git fetch &&   git checkout -b ${PROJECT_NAME} origin/${PROJECT_NAME} && git pull

    Then perform instructions from each of the folders.
    The detailed instruction is available at https://github.com/gabrielstar/atlassian_stack/wiki.

SET-UP STEPS:

    1. Set up PG_ADMIN ${PG_ADMIN_IP}:9999 and POSTGRES-9.6 under  ${POSTGRES_IP}:64320
    2. Set up Confluence stand-alone under http://${CONFLUENCE_IP}:8090/confluence
    3  Set up JIRA stand-alone under http://${JIRA_IP}:8080/jira
    4. Set up Crowd stand-alone under http://${CROWD_IP}:8095/crowd
    5. Set up Apache with HTTP under http://${HTTP_URL} and Configure services under http://${HTTP_URL}/confluence, http://${HTTP_URL}/jira

ADDITIONAL STEPS
